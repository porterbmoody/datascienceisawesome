## Education

My name is Porter and I went to BYU - Idaho to study Data science with a math minor. 

I love digging deeper into the doctrine to really try to understand what the scriptures are saying and what God's interactions and dealings with his people mean. I love programming in python, r, SQL, and learing about statistics, machine learning algorithms. Linear algebra is the most fascination math topic I have ever studied.

If you want to read up on some of my data science/math/coding insights I have created ![a blog for that](ilovedatascience.academy) too.

## Background

I grew up in Colorado, served a mission in Charlotte, North Carolina Spanish speaking, but I didn't finish my entire mission so I did the service mission for a while. 



## Purpose

The purpose of this blog is to share findings and insights I came across that may help someone getting a deeper or fuller grasp of the gospel doctrine, history, scriptures or any topic in between. Another purpose is to help people increase or maintatain their faith.
